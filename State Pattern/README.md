Introduction
----
The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It encapsulates different behaviors into separate state classes and allows the object to switch between these states dynamically.

Real Problem Example: Player Application
----
To understand the State pattern better, let's consider an example of a Player application. This application allows users to play different types of media, such as audio and video files. However, the behavior of the player needs to change based on the current state, such as playing, paused, or stopped.

The Problem
-----
Without using the State pattern, managing the behavior of the player can become complex and error-prone. For example, if we have multiple if-else statements to handle different states, the code can quickly become cluttered and difficult to maintain. Additionally, adding new states or modifying existing ones can lead to code duplication and inconsistencies.

The Solution: State Pattern
----
The State pattern provides a solution to the problem by encapsulating each state into a separate class. Each state class implements a common interface, allowing the player to switch between states seamlessly. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and extensibility.

Structure of the State Pattern
----
The State pattern consists of three main components:

Context: Represents the object whose behavior changes based on its internal state. In our example, the Player application is the context.
```
class Player:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = None

    def set_state(self, state):
        self.state = state

    def play(self):
        self.state.play()

    def pause(self):
        self.state.pause()

    def stop(self):
        self.state.stop()
  ```
State: Defines an interface or an abstract class that encapsulates the behavior associated with a particular state. Each state class implements this interface.
```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class State(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def play(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def pause(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def stop(self):
        pass
```
Concrete States: These are the individual state classes that implement the State interface. Each state class represents a specific behavior of the context object.
```
class PlayState(State):
    def play(self):
        print("Already playing...")

    def pause(self):
        print("Pausing the player...")
        # Transition to PauseState
        self.context.set_state(PauseState())

    def stop(self):
        print("Stopping the player...")
        # Transition to StopState
        self.context.set_state(StopState())

class PauseState(State):
    def play(self):
        print("Resuming the player...")
        # Transition to PlayState
        self.context.set_state(PlayState())

    def pause(self):
        print("Already paused...")

    def stop(self):
        print("Stopping the player...")
        # Transition to StopState
        self.context.set_state(StopState())

class StopState(State):
    def play(self):
        print("Starting the player...")
        # Transition to PlayState
        self.context.set_state(PlayState())

    def pause(self):
        print("Cannot pause, player is stopped...")

    def stop(self):
        print("Already stopped...")
```

By using the State pattern, we can easily add new states, modify existing ones, and manage the behavior of the Player application in a more organized and maintainable way.
