What is the Command Pattern?
----
The Command Pattern is a behavioural design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing clients to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. It promotes loose coupling between the sender and receiver of a request.

Example of a Real Problem: Player Application
-----
Consider a Player application that needs to handle various commands, such as PlayCommand, PauseCommand, and StopCommand. Each command represents a specific action that can be performed on the player. The challenge is to decouple the sender of the command from the receiver and provide a flexible way to execute and manage commands.

Why is it a Problem?
-----
The traditional approach of directly invoking methods on the receiver object from the sender object can lead to tight coupling and limited flexibility. It becomes challenging to add new commands or modify existing ones without modifying the sender code.

How Does the Pattern Solve It?
------
The Command Pattern solves these problems by introducing an intermediate command object that encapsulates the request and its parameters. The sender object only needs to know about the command interface, promoting loose coupling. The receiver object, which performs the actual action, is decoupled from the sender and can be easily modified or extended.

Structure of the Command Pattern:
------
The Command Pattern consists of the following components:

```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Command(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self):
        pass

class PlayCommand(Command):
    def __init__(self, player):
        self.player = player

    def execute(self):
        self.player.play()

class PauseCommand(Command):
    def __init__(self, player):
        self.player = player

    def execute(self):
        self.player.pause()

class StopCommand(Command):
    def __init__(self, player):
        self.player = player

    def execute(self):
        self.player.stop()

class Player:
    def play(self):
        print("Playing...")

    def pause(self):
        print("Paused...")

    def stop(self):
        print("Stopped...")

class RemoteControl:
    def __init__(self):
        self.command = None

    def set_command(self, command):
        self.command = command

    def press_button(self):
        self.command.execute()
```

Conclusion:
----
In this tutorial, we explored the Command Pattern and its implementation in a Player application. We learned how the Command Pattern provides a flexible and decoupled way to encapsulate requests as objects, allowing for easy parameterization, queuing, logging, and undoable operations. By using the Command Pattern, the Player application became more maintainable and extensible.

By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can apply the Command Pattern in your own projects to improve code design and manage requests effectively.
I hope this tutorial helps you understand and implement the Command Pattern in your Player application. Happy coding!
