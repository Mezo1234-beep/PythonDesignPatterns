Introduction
---
The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled or reaches the end of the chain. It promotes loose coupling between senders and receivers and provides flexibility in handling requests.

Real Problem Example: Player Application
----
To understand the Chain of Responsibility pattern better, let's consider the example of a Player application again. In this application, different types of media files need to be played, and each file type requires a specific player to handle it.

The Problem
-----
Without using the Chain of Responsibility pattern, managing the playback of different media files can become complex and inflexible. For example, if we have multiple if-else statements to handle different file types, adding or modifying file types can be challenging. Additionally, the code can become tightly coupled, making it difficult to add new players or modify existing ones.

The Solution: Chain of Responsibility Pattern
-----
The Chain of Responsibility pattern provides a solution to the problem by decoupling the sender of a request (the Player application) from its receivers (the media players). Each media player in the chain has the ability to handle a specific file type. If a player cannot handle the file type, it passes the request to the next player in the chain until the request is handled or reaches the end of the chain.

Structure of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern
------
The Chain of Responsibility pattern consists of three main components:

Handler: Defines an interface or an abstract class that declares the method for handling requests. In our example, this can be an abstract class called MediaPlayer with a method play(file).
```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class MediaPlayer(ABC):
    def __init__(self):
        self.next_player = None

    def set_next(self, player):
        self.next_player = player

    @abstractmethod
    def play(self, file):
        pass
```
Concrete Handlers: These are the individual media player classes that implement the MediaPlayer interface. Each player class decides whether it can handle the file type or passes the request to the next player in the chain.
```
class AudioPlayer(MediaPlayer):
    def play(self, file):
        if file.type == "audio":
            print("Playing audio file:", file.name)
        elif self.next_player is not None:
            self.next_player.play(file)

class VideoPlayer(MediaPlayer):
    def play(self, file):
        if file.type == "video":
            print("Playing video file:", file.name)
        elif self.next_player is not None:
            self.next_player.play(file)
```
Request: Represents the request being passed along the chain. In our example, this can be a File class that contains the necessary information for the players to determine if they can handle the file type.
```
class File:
    def __init__(self, name, type):
        self.name = name
        self.type = type
```

By using the Chain of Responsibility pattern, we can easily add new players for different file types, modify the behavior of existing players, and manage the playback of different media files in a flexible and maintainable way.
