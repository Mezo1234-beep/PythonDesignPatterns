What is the Factory Pattern?
-----------
The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It promotes loose coupling and provides a flexible way to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client.

Example of a Real Problem: Player Application
-----
Consider a Player application that needs to handle different types of players, such as AudioPlayer, VideoPlayer, and ImagePlayer. Each player type has its implementation and behaviour. The challenge is to create and manage these player objects in a flexible and extensible way.

Why is it a Problem?
----
The traditional approach of directly creating player objects using constructors or factory methods can lead to tight coupling, code duplication, and difficulty in adding new player types. It becomes challenging to modify the code when new player types are introduced or when the creation logic needs to change.

How Does the Pattern Solve It?
------
The Factory Pattern solves these problems by providing a central factory class that encapsulates the creation logic. It allows for the creation of different types of players based on runtime conditions or configuration settings. The client code interacts with the factory interface, promoting loose coupling and code reusability.

Structure of the Factory Pattern:
   ------

```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Player(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def play(self):
        pass

class AudioPlayer(Player):
    def play(self):
        print("Playing audio...")

class VideoPlayer(Player):
    def play(self):
        print("Playing video...")

class ImagePlayer(Player):
    def play(self):
        print("Displaying image...")

class PlayerFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_player(player_type):
        if player_type == "audio":
            return AudioPlayer()
        elif player_type == "video":
            return VideoPlayer()
        elif player_type == "image":
            return ImagePlayer()
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid player type.")
```

Conclusion:
----
In this tutorial, we explored the Factory Pattern and its implementation in a Player application. We learned how the Factory Pattern provides a flexible and extensible way to create objects while promoting loose coupling and code reusability. By using the Factory Pattern, the Player application became more maintainable and scalable, allowing for easy addition of new player types.

By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can apply the Factory Pattern in your projects to improve code design and manage object creation effectively.
I hope this tutorial helps you understand and implement the Factory Pattern in your Player application. Happy coding!
