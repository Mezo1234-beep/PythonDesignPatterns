Introduction
---
The Visitor pattern is a behavioural design pattern that allows adding new operations to existing classes without modifying their structure. It separates the algorithm from the objects on which it operates, promoting extensibility and flexibility.

Real Problem Example: Player Application
----
To understand the Visitor pattern better, let's consider the example of a Player application again. In this application, we have different types of media files such as audio and video, and we need to perform various operations on these files, such as playing, converting, and analyzing.

The Problem
-----
Without using the Visitor pattern, adding new operations to the media file classes can become challenging. If we directly modify the media file classes, it violates the Open-Closed Principle and can lead to code duplication. Additionally, if we have multiple file types, the code for each operation can become complex and tightly coupled.

The Solution: Visitor Pattern
-----
The Visitor pattern provides a solution to the problem by separating the operations from the media file classes. It introduces a separate set of visitor classes that define the operations to be performed on the media files. Each media file class accepts a visitor, which then performs the specific operation on the file.

Structure of the Visitor Pattern
-----
The Visitor pattern consists of three main components:

Visitor: Defines the interface or abstract class that declares the visit methods for each media file type. In our example, this can be an abstract class called MediaFileVisitor with visit methods for each file type.
```from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class MediaFileVisitor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def visit_audio(self, audio_file):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def visit_video(self, video_file):
        pass
```
Concrete Visitors: These are the individual visitor classes that implement the MediaFileVisitor interface. Each visitor class defines the specific operation to be performed on each media file type.
```
class PlayVisitor(MediaFileVisitor):
    def visit_audio(self, audio_file):
        print("Playing audio file:", audio_file.name)

    def visit_video(self, video_file):
        print("Playing video file:", video_file.name)

class ConvertVisitor(MediaFileVisitor):
    def visit_audio(self, audio_file):
        print("Converting audio file:", audio_file.name)

    def visit_video(self, video_file):
        print("Converting video file:", video_file.name)
```
Media File Classes: These are the classes representing different media file types. Each media file class accepts a visitor and calls the appropriate visit method based on its type.
```
class AudioFile:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def accept(self, visitor):
        visitor.visit_audio(self)

class VideoFile:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def accept(self, visitor):
        visitor.visit_video(self)
```

By using the Visitor pattern, we can easily add new operations to the Player application without modifying the media file classes. Each visitor class can define its own behaviour for each media file type, promoting extensibility and maintainability.
