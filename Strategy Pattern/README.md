What is the Strategy Pattern?
 ------
The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It promotes loose coupling and allows for dynamic behavior changes without modifying the client code.

Example of a Real Problem: Player Application
------
Consider a Player application that needs to support different playback strategies, such as NormalPlayback, ShufflePlayback, and RepeatPlayback. Each strategy represents a different way of playing the media. The challenge is to provide a flexible and extensible way to switch between playback strategies without modifying the player code.

Why is it a Problem?
------
The traditional approach of implementing different playback strategies directly in the player class can lead to code duplication and tight coupling. It becomes challenging to add new strategies or modify existing ones without modifying the player code. Additionally, the player class may become bloated with multiple conditional statements.

How Does the Pattern Solve It?
------
The Strategy Pattern solves these problems by extracting the different playback strategies into separate classes. It defines a common interface for all strategies, allowing them to be used interchangeably. The player class holds a reference to the selected strategy and delegates the playback behavior to it. This promotes loose coupling, code reusability, and easy addition of new strategies.

Structure of the Strategy Pattern:
------
The Strategy Pattern consists of the following components:

```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PlaybackStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def play(self, playlist):
        pass

class NormalPlayback(PlaybackStrategy):
    def play(self, playlist):
        print("Playing playlist in normal order:", playlist)

class ShufflePlayback(PlaybackStrategy):
    def play(self, playlist):
        print("Playing playlist in shuffle order:", playlist)

class RepeatPlayback(PlaybackStrategy):
    def play(self, playlist):
        print("Playing playlist in repeat mode:", playlist)

class Player:
    def __init__(self, strategy):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def set_strategy(self, strategy):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def play_playlist(self, playlist):
        self.strategy.play(playlist)
```

Conclusion:
----
In this tutorial, we explored the Strategy Pattern and its implementation in a Player application. We learned how the Strategy Pattern provides a flexible and extensible way to switch between different algorithms at runtime. By using the Strategy Pattern, the Player application became more maintainable, reusable, and adaptable to different playback strategies.
